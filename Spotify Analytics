# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Who are the top 10 most popular artist?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#2. Which artist has the most danceable song and what is the song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability in (SELECT max(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);

#3. Which artist has the most appearances in the Top 50 and who is the artist?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) as appearances
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY appearances desc
LIMIT 1;
